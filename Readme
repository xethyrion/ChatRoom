A user first needs to authenticate using /Authenticate Joe 321 (for example, user.db can be edited for customization.)
The Server accepts the following commands once the client connection is established:
1. "/Nick DesiredNick" - Sets the client's nick to DesiredNick
2. "/Say message here" - Message here.
3. "/Disconnect" - Tells the server you want to disconnect and closes connection.
