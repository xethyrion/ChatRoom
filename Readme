A Simple ChatRoom
A user connects, sets up a nickname and is capable of sending messages to anyone
The Server accepts the following commands once the client connection is established:
1. "/Nick DesiredNick" - Sets the client's nick to DesiredNick
2. "/Say message here" - Message here.
3. "/Disconnect" - Tells the server you want to disconnect and closes connection.
